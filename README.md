# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description | Link |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Profit & Operational Analysis - Superstore Mock Data| This project required me to review the Superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid possible bankruptcy. | |
| 2 | Returned Orders Analysis - Superstore Mock Data | I prepared an analysis (via interactive dashboards) to help Superstore understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. | |
| 3 | Shopify App Analysis | "Hired" to review the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform, using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites. I also had to figure out what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app. | [Screenshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11DR_Sv7a4qmCwwZBBv_6Pfni3DaLB7ss?usp=sharing) |
| 4 | Zomato Restaurant Decomposition & Analysis | I was 'hired' as a junior analyst for Zomato to determine restaurant-specific data insights. I submitted a decomposition plan to my team lead, and then gave business recommendations for new/existing restaurants based on my subsequent analysis.| |
